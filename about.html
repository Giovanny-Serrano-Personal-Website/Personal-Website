    <p class = "context2">As a fulltime student and fulltime employee for Amazon, it is hard to find the time to destress and not focus on work or school. Growing up, soccer was a big part of my life, I had daily trainings and would travel for games and tournaments throughout the United States. Today, I play locally three times a week and these games provide the best escape from my daily routines.</p>
