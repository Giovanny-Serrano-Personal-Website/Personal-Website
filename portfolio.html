            <p class = "statement2">This website was made on Wix for a local hardscape design business in Phoenix, Arizona. The site focuses on the company's work and aimed to provide an easy way for new potential clients to express their interest in their work. The site also had an online market that used square to pay for their items. The store has recently been shut down due to it only being a promotional event.</p>

            <p class = "statement3">Freeport is a well known 3rd part logistics company based in Phoenix, Arizona. They wanted a singpage website for their transportation division where their drivers were able to check their upcoming driving schedules. I created the single page on webflow and used CSS to make the page easy to read for the drivers. The page listed the driver's name, the truck they were using, their start time, and their first trip. </p>
